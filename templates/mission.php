          <p>Hello, agent. Welcome to Command.</p>
          <p>As your leaders, we aim to keep you safe, happy, and productive. Your well-being is of utmost importance to us, and we will do everything to make that happen. Some might not agree with our ways, but we believe that the end justifies the means.</p>

              <p>The capital Division and home of Command, it lies in geographical center of Fyzai. The presence of Command has made it the most technologically advanced and militarized of the Divisions. Its inhabitants are known to be cunning individualists that believe that cynicism is necessary for progress.</p>

              <p>Most raw materials come from this Division, as the plains it encompasses gives it enough space to grow livestock and crops.

Research labs also dot the lands of Czar, housing scientists who study the modification of crops and animal nutrition.</p>

              <p>The Division by the ocean which oversees trade between Fyzai and neighboring countries. It is common for citizens of this Division to travel outside of Fyzai, and as such they are considered the most well-learned in the country, and are usually recruited by Command. As news from the outside world travels through here before it reaches Mars, the Division is crawling with interested spies and foreign agents. The Division is also known for Fyzai-1, the country's first nuclear power plant.</p>

          <p>Your mission is to retrieve the Phlogiston, located in the deserts of Fyzai. It is a machine capable of reversing entropy. If in the right hands, this object could be the key to unlimited energy.</p>
          <p>Retrieval will not be easy. You will not only have to battle with the harsh deserts, but a few dissenters will be racing you to the finish line. But you do not need to worry, as some of our best agents are actively working against them.</p>

            <p>Also known as "They Who Speak In Hands", they are a select group of agents determined to keep peace in the land by whatever means necessary. While they will help you in your mission, it is imperative that you do not disobey them. After all, in Fyzai there is only one rule: Cross Command, face The Silencers.</p>

            <p>The Entity is a terrorist group, determined to topple our peaceful society down. Through several proxy groups, they have orchestrated multiple attacks against the state.</p>
            <p>Not much is known about the group, but one thing is certain. It is critical that the Phlogiston will not fall into the Entity's hands. A great source of power falling into an enemy's hands assures the destruction of our state, and Command is determined to not let that happen. After all, we have our best agents going after them.</p>
